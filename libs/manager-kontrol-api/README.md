# Manager-Kloud-Kontrol API

The OpenAPI specs are located in the `specs` directory. Whenever the specs are updated, the REST API bindings should be regenerated. This can be done by running the following command:

```bash
# Make sure your are inside a nix shell (nix develop)
./scripts/build.sh
'''
```
